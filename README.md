# Weather Application

Very simple weather application using NodeJS, Express, Darksky.net API and Mapbox API for some geocoding.

Uses callbacks, client-side JS, ES6/ES7 JS, Async. functions and URL encoding to get our API hooked up correctly.

Deployed to Heroku for your viewing. Enjoy! :sparkler:
